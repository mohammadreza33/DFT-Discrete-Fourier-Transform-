# DFT-Discrete-Fourier-Transform-
Fourier transform computation of a discrete signal with Python3

We will generate a sinusoidal signal with a specific frequency and will send points of it to the algorithm as discrete points.
Finally, using the Python Pyplot library, we will draw the graph of the Fourier transform.

When you run the program you will hear the sound generated by the frequency!!
Of course, this is to check the type of noise sent to the algorithm.

You can use any other frequency instead of using the sinusoidal frequency.
Or you can send discrete points directly to the algorithm as follows:
s = [1,-3,2,4] or something else.

To test the algorithm, after displaying DFT graphs, the resulting FFT function graphs in the Python numpy library will also be displayed.
You can compare the results!. also You can use Matlab's FFT and compare the results :)
